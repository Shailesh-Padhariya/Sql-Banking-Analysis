Bank Data Analysis

Project Overview

This project involves analyzing banking data to create a Master Table that consolidates client, account, transaction, loan, and demographic information. The goal is to structure and integrate multiple datasets for efficient querying and insights.

Dataset Description

The data consists of multiple relational tables representing different aspects of the banking system:

Accounts: Basic account details (creation date, branch, etc.).

Clients: Information about individual bank clients.

Disposition: Relationship between accounts and clients (who can access which account).

Orders: Payment orders linked to accounts.

Transactions: Records of all transactions performed.

Loans: Details of loans issued to accounts.

Credit Cards: Credit card data linked to accounts.

Demographic Data: Publicly available district-level statistics.

Data Processing & Integration

Using SQL:

Imported and cleaned all datasets.

Merged related tables to link transactions, loans, and orders to accounts.

Integrated demographic data to provide additional insights.

Created a Master Table that consolidates all key banking information.

Tools Used

SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL) â€“ Data integration, cleaning, and querying.

Excel/Pandas â€“ Data verification and validation.

Relational Database Concepts â€“ Efficient table structuring and normalization.

This project provides a structured approach to handling large-scale banking data for better financial analysis and reporting. ðŸ“ŠðŸš€
